## 2.0 Theme, files, imports, and caching

The Star Wars saga  has spawned films, animated series, books, music, artwork, toys, games, fandom
websites, emojis, cosplayers, scientific names for new organisms (e.g.,
[_Trigonopterus yoda_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonopterus_yoda)), and even a Darth Vader
_grotesque_ attached to the
[northwest tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader_grotesque#/media/File:Darth_vader_grotesque.jpg)
of the Washington National Cathedral. Leading US news sources such as the
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) cover the Star Wars phenomenon on a regular basis.

The last assignment adds yet another Star Wars-inspired artifact to the list. The data used in this
assignment is sourced from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.py4e.com/) (SWAPI),
[Wookieepedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page),
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), and the
[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/star-wars).

### 2.1 Files

In line with the weekly lab exercises and problem sets you will be provided with a number of
files:

| File | Purpose |
| :-- | :------ |
| `last_assignment-README.md` | Assignment instructions |
| `last_assignment.py` | Program/script including a `main()` function and other definitions and statements. |
| `five_oh_six.py` | Module containing utility functions and statements. |
| `data-clone_wars_episodes.csv` | Data file. |
| `data-jedi.json` | Data file. |
| `data-key_mappings.json` | Data file. |
| `data-nyt_star_wars_articles.json` | Data file. |
| `data-wookieepedia_droids.json` | Data file. |
| `data-wookieepedia_people.json` | Data file. |
| `data-wookieepedia_planets.csv` | Data file. |
| `data-wookieepedia_starships.csv` | Data file. |
| `fxt_*.json` | Collection of test fixture files that you must match with the files you produce. |

Please download the assignment files from Canvas Files as soon as they are released. This is a timed
event and delays in acquiring the assignment files will shorten the time available to engage with
the challenges. The clock is not your friend.

:exclamation: _DO NOT_ modify or remove the scaffolded code that we provide in the Python script or
module files unless instructed to do so.

### 2.2 Module imports

The template file `last_assignment.py` includes the following `import` statements:

```python
import copy
import five_oh_six as utl

from pathlib import Path
```

The utilities module `five_oh_six.py` includes the following `import` statements:

```python
import csv
import json
import requests

from urllib.parse import quote, urlencode, urljoin
```

:exclamation: **Do not** comment out or remove these `import` statements. Check your `import`
statements periodically. If you discover that other `import` statements have been added to
your Python files remove them. In such cases, VS Code is attempting to assist you by inserting
additional `import` statements based on your keystrokes. Their presence can trigger
`ModuleNotFoundError` runtime exceptions when you submit your code to Gradescope.

### 2.3 Caching

As discussed in class, this assignment utilizes a caching workflow that eliminates
redundant HTTP GET requests made to SWAPI by storing the SWAPI responses locally. Caching is
implemented _fully_ and all you need do is call the function `get_swapi_resource()` whenever you
need to retrieve a SWAPI representation of a person/droid, planet, species, or starship, either
locally from the cache or remotely from SWAPI. The cache dictionary is serialized as JSON and
written to `CACHE.json` every time you run `last_assignment.py`.

:exclamation: _Do not_ call the function named `utl.get_resource` directly. Doing so sidesteps the
cache and undercuts the caching optimization strategy.

## 3.0 Challenges

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, there occured the Clone Wars (22-19 BBY), a major
conflict that pitted the [Galatic Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Republic)
against the breakaway
[Separatist Alliance](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems). The
Republic fielded genetically modified human clone troopers commanded by members of the Jedi order
against Separatist battle droids. The struggle was waged across the galaxy and, in time, inspired an
animated television series entitled
[_Star Wars: The Clone Wars_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars) which
debuted in October 2008 and ran for seven seasons (2008-2014, 2020).

The last assignment features four groups of challenges:

**Challenge 01_02**. Implement a number of `utl.to_*()` functions employing `try` and `except`
blocks that will be employed in later challenges.

:bulb: Any challenges that implement `utl.*` function definitions will be completed in the provided
`"five_oh_six.py"` module. Any challenges/task referencing `main()` or functions without the `utl`
alias will be completed in the provided `"last_assignment.py"` file.

**Challenges 03-06**. Utilize a _Clone Wars_ data set that provides summary data about the animated
series. You will implement a number of functions that will simplify interacting with the data in
order to surface basic information about the episodes and their directors, writers, and viewership.

**Challenges 07-09**. Work with New York Times article data that charts the creative, cultural, and
economic impact of the _Star Wars_ saga both within the US and elsewhere over the past forty-six
years.

**Challenges 10-20**. Recreates the escape of the light freighter
[_Twilight_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight) from the sabotaged and doomed Separatist
heavy cruiser [_Malevolence_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malevolence) which took place
during the first year of the _Clone Wars_ conflict (22 BBY).

Your task is to reassemble the crew of the _Twilight_ and take on passengers before disengaging from
the _Malevolence_ and heading into deep space. The Jedi generals
[Anakin Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker) and
[Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi) together with the astromech droid
(robot) [R2-D2](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2) had earlier boarded the _Malevolence_
after maneuvering the much smaller _Twilight_ up against the heavy cruiser and
docking via an emergency air lock. Their mission was twofold:

   1. Retrieve the Republican Senator
      [Padmé Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala) and the protocol
      (communications) droid [C-3PO](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO) whose ship had been
      seized after being caught in the _Malevolence's_ tractor beam.
   2. Sabotage the warship.

In these challenges you will implement functions and follow a workflow that generates a JSON
document that recreates the _Twilight's_ escape from the _Malevolence_.

**May the Force be with You.**

## 3.1 Challenge 01 (75 points)

**Task**: Implement the functions `utl.to_float()` and `utl.to_int()`.Each function attempts to
convert a passed in `value` to a more appropriate type.

### 3.1.1 Implement `utl.to_float()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert the passed in `value` to a `float`.
Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions whenever an invalid
   conversion is attempted.

   :exclamation: **Do not** place code outside the `try` and `except` code blocks.

2. The function _must_ convert numbers masquerading as strings, incuding those with commas that
   represent a thousand separator (e.g., '500,000,000') _and_ those with a period that designates a
   fractional component (e.g., '500,000,000.9999'), to a whole number.

3. Make use of the built-in function `isinstance()` to confirm that the passed in `value` is a
   string. Some strings may need to be manipulated before attempting the float conversion.

   :bulb: Recall that `isinstance()` accepts two arguments: an object and a type. The function
   returns `True` if the object is of the specified type; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. If a runtime exception is encountered "catch" the exception in the `except` block and return the
   `value` to the caller **unchanged**.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify specific exceptions in the `except` statement.

### 3.1.2 Test `utl.to_float()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`. Uncomment the relevant `assert` statements.
Run your code. If an `AssertionError` is raised, debug your code, and then retest. Repeat as
necessary.

### 3.1.3 Implement `utl.to_int()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert the passed in `value` to an `int`. Review
the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines,
and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions whenever an invalid
   conversion is attempted.

   :exclamation: **Do not** place code outside the `try` and `except` code blocks.

2. The function _must_ convert numbers masquerading as strings, incuding those with commas that
   represent a thousand separator (e.g., '500,000,000') _and_ those with a period that designates a
   fractional component (e.g., '500,000,000.9999'), to a whole number.

   :bulb: Recall that `int()` truncates the fractional component of a number. Given this plus the
   requirement above, consider leveraging `to_float()` in the function block.

3. If a runtime exception is encountered "catch" the exception in the `except` block and return the
   `value` to the caller **unchanged**.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify specific exceptions in the `except` statement.

### 3.1.4 Test `utl.to_int()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`. Uncomment the relevant `assert` statements.
Run your code. If an `AssertionError` is raised, debug your code, and then retest. Repeat as
necessary.

## 3.2 Challenge 02 (75 points)

**Task**: Implement the functions `utl.to_list()`and `utl.to_none()`. Each function attempts to
convert a passed in `value` to a more appropriate type.

### 3.2.1 Implement `utl.to_list()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert the passed in `value` to a `list` using a
`delimiter` if one is provided. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is
to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions whenever an invalid
   conversion is attempted.

   :exclamation: **Do not** place code outside the `try` and `except` code blocks.

2. If the caller provides a `delimiter` value the function _must_ use it to split the `value`;
   otherwise, split the string without specifying a delimiter value.

   :bulb: Let the truth value of `delimiter` determine how you choose to split the string.

   :exclamation: Don't assume that `value` is "clean"; program defensively and remove
   leading/trailing spaces before attempting to convert the string to a list.

3. If a runtime exception is encountered "catch" the exception in the `except` block and return the
   `value` to the caller **unchanged**.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify specific exceptions in the `except` statement.

### 3.2.2 Test `utl.to_list()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`. Uncomment the relevant `assert` statements.
Run your code. If an `AssertionError` is raised, debug your code, and then retest. Repeat as
necessary.

### 3.2.3 Implement `utl.to_none()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert the passed in `value` to `None`. Review
the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines,
and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions whenever an invalid
   conversion is attempted.

   :exclamation: **Do not** place code outside the `try` and `except` code blocks.

2. In the `try` block check if the passed in `value` can be found in the passed in
   `none_values` list (perform a **case insensitive** membership check). If a match is
   obtained return `None` to the caller; otherwise, return the `value` unchanged.

   :exclamation: Don't assume that `value` is "clean"; program defensively and remove
   leading/trailing spaces before checking if the "cleaned" version of the string matches a
   `none_values` item.

3. If a runtime exception is encountered "catch" the exception in the `except` block and return the
   `value` to the caller **unchanged**.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify specific exceptions in the `except` statement.

### 3.2.4 Test `utl.to_none()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`. Uncomment the relevant `assert` statements.
Run your code. If an `AssertionError` is raised, debug your code, and then retest. Repeat as
necessary.

## 3.3 Challenge 03 (80 points)

**Task**: Refactor (e.g., modify) the function `utl.read_csv_to_dicts()` to use a
**list comprehension** and then call the function to read a CSV file that contains information about
the _Clone Wars_ episodes. Then implement the function `has_viewer_data()` that checks whether or
not an episode possesses viewership information.

:bulb: This challenge involves a list of nested dictionaries. Use the built-in function `print()` to
explore one of nested dictionaries or call the function `utl.write_json()` in `main()`, encode the
data as JSON, and write it to a "test" JSON file so that you can view the list of dictionaries more
easily.

### 3.3.1 Refactor `utl.read_csv_to_dicts()`

Examine the commented out code in `utl.read_csv_to_dicts()` function (**do not** uncomment).
Reimplement the function by writing code inside the `with` block that retrieves an instance of the
`csv.DictReader` and then employs a list comprehension to traverse the lines in the reader object
and return a new list of line elements to the caller.

:exclamation: Review lecture notes and code solution files if you have forgotten how to write a list
comprehension. If you are unsuccessful in your endeavors uncomment the code in
`utl.read_csv_to_dicts()` and get the function working so that you can continue with the assignment.

### Requirements

1. You are limited to writing one (`1`) line of code by employing a list comprehension.

2. You _must_ employ **existing variable names** that appear in the commented out code when
   writing your list comprehension.

   :exclamation: Utilize only those variable names that are relevant to the task at hand.

### 3.3.2 Test `utl.read_csv_to_dicts()`

After refactoring `utl.read_csv_to_dicts()` return to `main()`.

1. Call the function and retrieve the data contained in the file `data-clone_wars_episodes.csv`.

2. Assign the return value to a variable named `clone_wars_episodes`.

### 3.3.3 Implement `has_viewer_data()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that checks whether or not an individual _Clone Wars_ episode
possesses viewership information. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it
is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ compute the truth value of the passed in episode's "episode_us_viewers_mm"
   key-value pair, returning either `True` or `False` to the caller.

   :bulb: Recall that a function can include more than one `return` statement. That said, you can
   also employ Python's ternary operator to solve this challenge with a single line of code.

### 3.3.4 Call `has_viewer_data()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`.

1. Test your implementation of `has_viewer_data()` by counting the number of episodes in the
   `clone_wars_episodes` list that possess a "episode_us_viewers_mm" numeric value. Employ a loop,
   a conditional statement, and the accumulator pattern to accomplish the task. Whenever the return
   value of `has_viewer_data()` equals `True` increment your episode count by 1.

   :bulb: Recall that a function call is considered an expression and `if` statements are composed
   of one or more expressions.

2. The number of episodes that possess an "episode_us_viewers_mm" viewership value equals
   eighty-eight (`88`). If your loop does not accumulate this total, recheck both your implementation
   of `has_viewer_data()` and your `for` loop and loop block `if` statement.

## 3.4 Challenge 04 (100 points)

**Task**: Implement a function that converts _Clone Wars_ episode string values to more appropriate
types.

### 3.4.1 Implement `convert_episode_values()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that converts specifed string values to more appropriate types.
Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function accepts a list of nested "episode" dictionaries. You _must_ implement a nested
   loop to perform the value type conversions.

   * Outer loop: passed in `episodes` list of nested dictionaries.
   * Inner loop: individual "episode" dictionary items.

2. Employ `if-elif-else` conditional statements to convert the values encountered to more
   appropriate types. Utilize the conditional statements to perform the following operations on each
   key and value encountered:

   1. Check if the value is a member of `none_values`. If `True` assign `None` to the converted
      value's associated key.

   2. Convert certain episode string values to more appropriate types by passing the value to the
      appropriate `utl.to_*()` function and assigning the return value to the converted value's
      associated key. See the docstring's "Type conversions" section for a listing of required
      conversions.

      :bulb: Consider which conversions might be grouped together in your conditions. Remember that
      there can be more than one `elif` condition if needed.

3. After the outer loop terminates return the list of mutated dictionaries to the caller.

### 3.4.2 Call `convert_episode_values()`

After implementing the function, return to `main()`.

1. Call the function `convert_episode_values()` and pass it the following argument:
   `clone_wars_episodes` and the constant `NONE_VALUES`. Assign the return value to
   `clone_wars_episodes`.

2. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `clone_wars_episodes` to the file
   `stu-clone_wars-episodes_converted.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-clone_wars-episodes_converted.json`. Both files _must_ match, line-for-line, and
   character-for-character.

## 3.5 Challenge 05 (90 points)

**Task**: Implement a function that retrieves the most viewed _Clone Wars_ episode(s).

### 3.5.1 Implement `get_most_viewed_episode()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that finds the most viewed _Clone Wars_ episode(s) in the data
set. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters
it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ return a list of one or more episodes from the passed in
   `episodes` list that feature the highest recorded viewership. Include in the list
   only those episodes that tie for the highest recorded viewership. If no ties exist
   only one episode will be returned in the list.

2. The function _must_ exclude from the list all episodes that lack a viewership value.

3. Delegate to `has_viewer_data()` the task of checking whether an episode contains a _truthy_
   "episode_us_viewers_mm" value. The function needs to check the truth value of
   "episode_us_viewers_mm" before you attempt to compare the current "episode_us_viewers_mm" value
   to the previous value.

   :bulb: Assign two local "accumulator" variables to the viewer count and the top episode(s).

### 3.5.2 Call `get_most_viewed_episode()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`.

1. Call the function and pass it the following argument: `clone_wars_episodes`.

2. Assign the return value to `most_viewed_episode`. Pass the variable to `print()`
   and review the terminal output.  If the list contains the following elements
   proceed to the next challenge; if not, recheck your code.

   ```python
   [
      {
         'series_title': 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars',
         'series_season_num': 1,
         'series_episode_num': 2,
         'season_episode_num': 2,
         'episode_title': 'Rising Malevolence',
         'episode_director': 'Dave Filoni',
         'episode_writers': ['Steven Melching'],
         'episode_release_date': 'October 3, 2008',
         'episode_prod_code': 1.07,
         'episode_us_viewers_mm': 4.92
         },
      {
         'series_title': 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars',
         'series_season_num': 7,
         'series_episode_num': 134,
         'season_episode_num': 13,
         'episode_title': 'The Lecturers',
         'episode_director': 'Anthony Whyte',
         'episode_writers': ['Anthony Whyte', 'Chris Teplovs'],
         'episode_release_date': 'May 7, 2020',
         'episode_prod_code': 7.25,
         'episode_us_viewers_mm': 4.92
         }
   ]
   ```

## 3.6 Challenge 06 (100 points)

**Task**: Construct a dictionary of _Clone Wars_ directors along with a count of the number of
episodes each director directed. Sort by episode count (descending) and the director name
(ascending).

### 3.6.1 Implement `count_episodes_by_director()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a dictionary of key-value pairs that associate each
director in the `episodes` list with a count of the episodes that they are credited with directing.
Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it
defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The function _must_ accumulates episode counts for each director listed in the
   `episodes` list. Create an empty accumulator dictionary to hold the director-count key-value
   pairs (variable name your choice).

2. The director's name comprises the key and the associated value represents a count of
   the number of episodes that they directed.

   ```python
   {
      < director_name_01 >: < episode_count >,
      < director_name_02 >: < episode_count >,
      ...
   }
   ```

3. Employ a nested loop to solve this challenge. As you loop over each episode you will need to
   extract the director(s) from a string into a list and then loop over each in turn. In most cases
   you will encounter a single director but exceptions exist. For example Season 7, episode 128 was
   directed by Saul Ruiz and Bosco Ng.

   ```csv
   series_title,series_season_num,series_episode_num,season_episode_num,episode_title,episode_director, ....
   ...
   Star Wars: The Clone Wars,7,128,7,Dangerous Debt,"Saul Ruiz, Bosco Ng", ....
   ...
   ```

4. Implement conditional logic in the inner loop block to ensure each director's episode
   counts are properly tabulated per the following rules:

   1. Check if the local accumulator dictionary possesses a key-value pair for the
      director. If `True`, increment the associated value; otherwise add a new key-value pair to the
      dictionary.

   2. When accumulating values, increment the director's episode count by `1.0` (a
      `float`) **if, and only if,** the director is the only person credited with directing the
      episode.

   3. Otherwise, if two or more directors are credited with directing the episode
      allocate a fraction of `1.0` to each director's episode count. This value is calculated by
      dividing `1.0` by the number of directors credited with directing the episode.

      For example, if two directors are credited with directing the episode, each director's count
      is incremented by `0.5`; if three directors are credited with directing the episode, each
      director's count is incremented by `0.33`.

      :bulb: Employ simple division when incrementing the count. Consider how you can
      employ the list of directors in the equation that you write.

### 3.6.2 Call `count_episodes_by_director()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`.

1. Call the function and pass `clone_wars_episodes` to it as the argument.

2. Assign the return value to `director_episode_counts`.

3. **Uncomment** the provided dictionary comprehension that employs the built-in function `sorted()`
   and a `lambda` function to sort the episode counts by the count (descending) and the director's
   last name.

4. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write the _sorted_ `director_episode_counts` to the file
   `stu-clone_wars-director_episode_counts.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-clone_wars-director_episode_counts.json`. Both files _must_ match, line-for-line, and
   character-for-character.

## 3.7 Challenge 07 (75 points)

**Task**: Implement the function `get_news_desks()`.

### 3.7.1 Implement `get_news_desks()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a list of New York Times "news desks" sourced from the
passed in `articles` list. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to
perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

:bulb: Each article dictionary contains a "news_desk" key-value pair.

### Requirements

1. The list of news desk names returned by the function _must not_ contain any duplicate elements.
   Accumulate the values carefully.

2. The function must delegate to the function `utl.to_none()` the task of converting
   "news_desk" values that equal "None" (a string) to `None`. Only news_desk values that are
   "truthy" (i.e., not None) are to be returned in the list.

   :bulb: There are a number of articles with a "news_desk" value of "None". Exclude this
   value from the list by passing each "news_desk" value to `utl.to_none()` and assigning
   the return value to a local variable. You can filter out the `None` values with a truth value
   test.

3. The function _must_ return a new version of the accumulator list sorted
   alphanumerically.

### 3.7.2 Call `get_news_desks()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`.

1. Call the function `utl.read_json()` and retrieve the New York Times article data in the file
   `./data-nyt_star_wars_articles.json`. Assign the return value to `articles`.

2. Test your implementation of `get_news_desks()` by calling the function and passing to it the
   following arguments: `articles` and the constant `NONE_VALUES`. Assign the return value to the
   variable `news_desks`.

3. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `news_desks` to the file `stu-nyt_news_desks.json`.
   Compare your file to the test fixture file`fxt-nyt_news_desks.json`. The files _must_ match line
   for line, indent for indent, and character for character.

## 3.8 Challenge 08 (100 points)

**Task**: Implement the function `group_articles_by_news_desk()`.

### 3.8.1 Implement `group_articles_by_news_desk()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a dictionary of "news desk" key-value pairs that
group the passed in `articles` by their parent news desk drawn from the `news_desks` list. Review
the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines,
and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Assign an empty dictionary to a local variable.

2. Implement a nested loop. Review the `data-nyt_star_wars_articles.json` and `stu-nyt_news_desks.json`
   files and decide which list should be traversed by the outer loop and which list should be
   traversed by the inner loop.

   :bulb: The news desk name provides the link between the two lists.

3. Assign an empty list to a "parent" news desk key within the local dictionary you created in
   step 1. You will accumulate article dictionaries in this list.

   :bulb: There are three locations in
   the function block where this initial variable assignment could be placed: outside the
   loops, inside the outer loop, or inside the inner loop. Choose wisely.

4. Each article dictionary added to its parent news desk list represents a "thinned"
   version of the original. The keys to employ and their order is illustrated by the example below:

   ```python
   {
      "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/business/media/lucasfilm-sues-jedi-classes.html",
      "headline_main": "Classes for Jedis Run Afoul of the Lucasfilm Empire",
      "news_desk": "Business",
      "byline_original": "By Erin McCann",
      "document_type": "article",
      "material_type": "News",
      "abstract": "A man whose businesses offers private lessons and certifications for fine-tuning lightsaber skills is operating without the permission of the “Star Wars” owner.",
      "word_count": 865,
      "pub_date": "2016-10-19T13:26:21+0000"
   }
   ```

   :exclamation: Certain keys such as "headline_main", "byline_original", and "material_type" are
   not found in the original New York Times dictionaries. Hopefully, the names provide a sufficient
   hint about which values to map (i.e., assign) to each key.

### 3.8.2 Call `group_articles_by_news_desk()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`.

1. Call the function and pass it `news_desks` and `articles` as arguments. Assign the return value
   to the variable `news_desk_articles`.

2. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `news_desk_articles` to the file
   `stu-nyt_news_desk_articles.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-nyt_news_desk_articles.json`. The files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and
   character for character.

## 3.9 Challenge 09 (100 points)

**Task** Implement the function `calculate_articles_mean_word_count()`.

### 3.9.1 `calculate_articles_mean_word_count()` function

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns the mean (e.g., average) word count of the passed in
list of `articles` less any articles with a word count of zero (0). Review the function's docstring
to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

:bulb: **mean**: central value of a set of values that is determined by calculating
_the sum of the values divided by the number of values_.

**Requirements**

1. The function _must_ calculate the mean word count of the passed in articles **excluding** from
   the calculation all articles with a "word_count" value of zero (`0`) or `None`.

2. The function _must_ maintain a count of the number of articles evaluated and a count of the
   total words accumulated from each article's "word_count" value. Assign the running counts to
   two local "accumulator" variables.

3. The function _must_ check the truth value of each article's "word_count" before attempting to
    increment the article count and total words count. If the truth vallue of the "word_count" is
    `False` the article is excluded from the count.

4. The function _must_ **round** the mean value to the second (2nd) decimal place before returning
   the value to the caller.

### 3.9.2 Call `calculate_articles_mean_word_count()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`.

1. Create an empty dictionary named `mean_word_counts`. You will use it to accumulate mean words
   counts.

2. Loop over the `news_desk_articles` key-value pairs. Write a conditional statement inside the loop
   block that checks if the current key is a member of the `ignore` news desks tuple. If the key is
   **not** a member call the function `calculate_articles_mean_word_count()` and pass it the list of
   articles mapped (i.e., assigned) to the key.

3. Inside the loop add a new key-value pair to `mean_word_counts` consisting of the current key and
   the return value of the call to `calculate_articles_mean_word_count()`. Below is one of the
   key-value pairs added to `mean_word_counts` that your code _must_ produce:

   ```python
   {
      ...
      "Obits": 876.62,
      ...
   }
   ```

4. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `mean_word_counts` to the file
   `stu-nyt_news_desk_mean_word_counts.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-nyt_news_desk_mean_word_counts.json`. The files _must_ match line-for-line and
   character-for-character.

## 3.10 Challenge 10 (60 points)

**Task**: Implement the utility function `utl.get_nested_dict()`.

### 3.10.1 Implement `utl.get_nested_dict()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that utilizes a `filter` string to return a nested dictionary from
the passed in `data` list. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to
perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

The function is employed to traverse lists of nested dictionaries sourced from the
following files in search of a particular dictionary representation of a Star Wars droid,
person, planet, or starship:

* `data-wookieepedia_droids.json`
* `data-wookieepedia_people.json`
* `data-wookieepedia_planets.csv`
* `data-wookieepedia_starships.csv`

:bulb: Familiarize yourself with the Wookieepedia-sourced data files before commencing the remaining
challenges.

### Requirements

1. Loop over the nested dictionaries in the passed in `data` list.

2. Inside the loop block utilize the passed in `key` name to identify the key-value pair in the
   nested dictionary to evaluate. The value mapped to the `key` _must_ be compared to the passed in
   `filter` value using a **case sensitive** comparison. If an **exact match** is obtained the
   nested dictionary is returned to the caller; otherwise `None` is returned.

### 3.10.2 Call `utl.get_nested_dict()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`.

1. Call the function `utl.read_csv_to_dicts()` and retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia planet
   data in the file `data-wookieepedia_planets.csv`. Assign the return value to `wookiee_planets`.

2. Call the function `utl.get_nested_dict()` and pass it the following arguments:
   `wookiee_planets`, the key "name", and the string "Dagobah".

3. Assign the return value to the variable `wookiee_dagobah`.

4. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `wookiee_dagobah` to the file
   `stu-wookiee_dagobah.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file `fxt-wookiee_dagobah.json`
   The files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and character for character.

5. Call `utl.get_nested_dict()` a second time and pass it the following arguments:
   `wookiee_planets`, the key "system", and the string "Al'Har system".

6. Assign the return value to the variable `wookiee_haruun_kal`.

7. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `wookiee_haruun_kal` to the file
   `stu-wookiee_haruun_kal.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-wookiee_haruun_kal.json`. The files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and
   character for character.

## 3.11 Challenge 11 (85 points)

**Task**: Implement the functions `utl.to_gravity_value()` and `utl.to_year_era()`.

### 3.11.1 Implement `utl.to_gravity_value()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to convert a planet's "gravity" value to a float by
first removing the "standard" unit of measure substring (if it exists) before converting the
remaining number to a float. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to
perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

:bulb: Note that "gravity" values vary from planet to planet. The following examples illustrate
the challenge:

```python
{
    'name': Tatooine,
    ...
    'gravity': '1 standard',
    ...
}

{
   'name': Dagobah,
    ...,
    'gravity': 'N/A',
    ...
}

{
    'name': Haruun Kal,
    ...
    'gravity': '0.98',
    ...
}
```

### Requirements

1. Employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions whenever an invalid
   conversion is attempted.

   exclamation: **Do not** place code outside the `try` and `except` code blocks.

2. In the `try` block evaluate whether or not the substring "standard" is part of `value` (perform a
   _case insensitive_ check). If found, remove the substring and pass the new string
   to the function `utl.to_float()` in order to convert the numeric part of the `value` to
   a float. If the substring "standard" is not found pass `value` directly to `utl.to_float()`.

   :exclamation: Don't assume that `value` is "clean"; program defensively and remove
   leading/trailing spaces and commas before attempting to convert the "cleaned" version of the
   string to a float.

3. If a runtime exception is encountered "catch" the exception in the `except` block and return the
   `value` to the caller **unchanged**.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify specific exceptions in the `except` statement.

### 3.11.2 Test `utl.to_gravity_value()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`. Uncomment the relevant `assert` statements.
Run your code. If an `AssertionError` is raised, debug your code, and then retest. Repeat as
necessary.

### 3.11.3 Implement `utl.to_year_era()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that attempts to separate the Galactic standard calendar year and
era (e.g., 896BBY, 24ABY) value into a dictionary comprising year and era key-value pairs.

### Requirements

1. Employ `try` and `except` statements in order to handle runtime exceptions whenever an invalid
   conversion is attempted. **Do not** place code outside the `try` and `except` code blocks.

2. In the `try` block use slicing to access the year and era segments of the string.

   :bulb: Note that while the year segment's length varies (e.g., 896, 19, 0) the era segment of
   the Galactic calender date string comprises three characters: "BBY" or "ABY". Keep this in mind
   as you design your slicing expressions.

3. Before mapping the sliced segments to a dictionary, you _must_ first check if the "year" segment
   of the `value` is a number by employing the appropriate `str` method. If the substring
   **is numeric**, return a dictionary literal that maps the necessary slicing expressions to "year"
   and "era" keys as values. Structure the dictionary as follows:

   ```python
   {"year": < year > (int), "era": < era > (str)}
   ```

4. Otherwise, if the "year" segment is not considered numeric return the `value` to the caller
   **unchanged**.

5. If the year segment is numeric (check by calling the string's `isnumeric()` method), convert the
   "year" segment to an integer by passing it as the argument to the function `to_int()`. Call the
   function from within the dictionary literal.

6. If a runtime exception is encountered "catch" the exception in the `except` block and return the
   `value` to the caller **unchanged**.

   :bulb: You do not need to specify specific exceptions in the `except` statement.

### 3.11.4 Test `utl.to_year_era()`

After implementing the function return to `main()`. Uncomment the relevant `assert` statements.
Run your code. If an `AssertionError` is raised, debug your code, and then retest. Repeat as
necessary.

## Transforming data dictionaries (Challenges 12-16)

:bulb: The workflow outlined below illustrates the general creational pattern applied to each droid,
person, planet, species, and starship encountered in the following challenges.

<div style="background-color: #C1E1C1; border-radius: 10px; color: black; padding-top: 5px; padding-left: 3px; padding-right: 7px; padding-bottom: 3px">
   <ol>
      <li>
          Retrieve a SWAPI representation of the entity if one exists. Deserialize the JSON into a

      </li>
      <li>
          Retrieve a Wookieepedia representation of the entity if one exists. Read the data from

      <li>
          Perform an in-place operation that mutates the SWAPI dictionary with Wookieepedia

          certain values to more appropriate types, including replacing certain string values with
          <code style="color: blue">None</code>. Use the appropriate nested dictionary read from the

   </ol>
</div>
<br />

## 3.12 Challenge 12 (70 points)

**Task**: Implement the function `transform_planet()`.

### 3.12.1 Implement `transform_planet()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a dictionary representation of a planet based on the
passed in `data` dictionary. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it
is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Assign an empty dictionary to a local variable (name your choice). This "planet"
   dictionary will be employed to accumulate new key-value pairs sourced from the passed in `data`
   dictionary.

2. The function also requires that a dictionary of `keys` be provided by the caller. The
   `keys` dictionary (obtained from the file "data-key_mappings.json") includes nested droid, person,
   planet, species, and starship dictionaries. Each of these nested dictionaries specify the
   following attributes of the new dictionary that each `transform_*()` function will construct:

   * the subset of `data` key-value pairs to be mapped to the new dictionary.

   * the order in which the `data` key-value pairs are mapped to the new dictionary.

   * the key names to be used in the new dictionary.

   For example, each key in the `keys` "planet" dictionary corresponds to a key in the passed in
   `data` dictionary. Each value in the `keys` "planet" dictionary represents the (new) key name to
   be used in the new planet dictionary.

   ```python
   keys = {
        ...
        "planet": {
            "url": "url", # old key: new key
            ...,
            "orbital_period": "orbital_period_days", # old key: new key
            ...
        },
        ...
    }
   ```

3. Loop over the `keys` dictionary's nested "planet" dictionary's keys or items (your choice).
   Inside the loop block employ `if-elif-else` conditional statements to populate the new planet
   dictionary with key-value pairs sourced from `data`.

   :bulb: Each key in the `keys` nested "planet" dictionary maps to a `data` key-value pair. The
   associated value provides the **new key** to utilize in the new dictionary.

4. Inside the loop convert `data` values to more appropriate types as outlined in the docstring's
   mappings section. Strings found in `none_values` must be converted to `None`
   **irrespective of case**. Delegate type conversions to the various `utl.to_*()` functions. Then
   map the `data` value to the new key when assigning the key-value pair to the new dictionary.

   For example, if a `keys` key is named "diameter" perform the following actions:

   1. access the corresponding `data` "diameter" value, converting it as required to a more
      appropriate type or `None` using the appropriate `utl.to_*()` functions.

   2. assign the (converted) value to the new dictionary using the `keys` nested "planet"
      dictionary's "diameter_km" value as the new key.

   :bulb: Review the mappings carefully. Opportunities exist to reduce the number of `elif`
   statements by grouping keys whose values should be converted to the same type.

### 3.12.2 Test `transform_planet()`

After implementing `transform_planet()` return to `main()`.

1. Create a `pathlib.Path` object that provides an **absolute** path to the file
   "data-key_mappings.json". Assign the object to a variable named `keys_path`.

2. Call the function `utl.read_json()` passing it the argument `keys_path`. Assign the return
   value to a variable named `keys`.

   :bulb: Review the nested JSON objects in the file `data-key_mappings.json`. Each object provides
   a mapping of _current_ SWAPI/Wookieepedia key names to _new_ key names
   (e.g., "length" -> "length_m") for each entity featuring in this assignment. After deserializing
   the JSON into a dictionary of dictionaries you will employ these mappings to create new
   dictionary representations of droids, people, planets, species, and starships that, in certain
   cases, feature new key names.

3. Call the function `get_swapi_resource()` and retrieve a SWAPI representation of
   the planet [Tatooine](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine). Make use of
   the appropriate constant to simplify construction of the URL. Access the "Tatooine"
   dictionary which is stored in the response object and assign the value to
   `swapi_tatooine`.

4. Access the Wookieepedia representation of the planet. Call the function `utl.get_nested_dict()`
   and pass it the following arguments: `wookiee_planets`, the key "name", and the
   `swapi_tatooine` _name_ value. Assign the return value to `wookiee_tatooine`.

5. Combine the SWAPI and Wookieepedia planet dictionaries. Mutate `swapi_tatooine` by combining it
   with the Wookieepedia representation of the planet. Employ an in-place operation to accomplish
   the task.

6. Call the function `transform_planet()` and pass it the following arguments: `swapi_tatooine`,
   `keys`, and the constant `NONE_VALUES`. Assign the return value to a variable named `tatooine`.

7. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `tatooine` to the file `stu-tatooine.json`. Run
   your code. Compare your file to the test fixture file `fxt-tatooine.json`. Both files _must_
   match line for line, indent for indent, and character for character.

## 3.13 Challenge 13 (60 points)

**Task**: Implement the function `transform_droid()`.

### 3.13.1 Implement `transform_droid()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a dictionary representation of a driod (e.g., a
sentient robot) based on the passed in `data` dictionary. Review the function's docstring to
better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it
computes.

### Requirements

1. Assign an empty dictionary to a local variable (name your choice). This "droid"
   dictionary will be employed to accumulate new key-value pairs sourced from `data`.

2. Adopt the same key-value pair mapping pattern employed in the `transform_planet()` function. Loop
   over the `keys` dictionary's keys or items (your choice). Inside the loop block employ
   `if-elif-else` conditional statements to populate the new droid dictionary with key-value pairs
   sourced from `data`, converting `data` values to more appropriate types as outlined in the
   docstring's mappings section.

### 3.13.2 Test `transform_droid()`

After implementing `transform_droid()` return to `main()`.

1. Call the function `get_swapi_resource()` and retrieve a SWAPI representation of the astromech
   droid [R2-D2](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2). Make use of the appropriate constant to
   simplify construction of the URL. Access the "R2-D2" dictionary which is stored in the response
   object and assign the value to `swapi_r2_d2`.

2. Call the function `utl.read_json()` and retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia droid
   data in the file `data-wookieepedia_droids.json`. Assign the return value to
   `wookiee_droids`.

3. Access the Wookieepedia representation of the droid.  Call the function `utl.get_nested_dict()`
   and pass it the following arguments: `wookiee_droids`, the key "name", and the
   `swapi_r2_d2` _name_ value. Assign the return value to `wookiee_r2_d2`.

4. Combine the SWAPI and Wookieepedia droid dictionaries. Mutate `swapi_r2_d2` by combining it
   with the Wookieepedia representation of the droid. Employ an in-place operation to accomplish
   the task.

5. Call the function `transform_droid()` and pass it the following arguments: `swapi_r2_d2`, `keys`,
   and the constant `NONE_VALUES`. Assign the return value to a variable named `r2_d2`.

6. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `r2_d2` to the file `stu-r2_d2.json`. Run your
   code. Compare your file to the test fixture file `fxt-r2_d2.json`. Both files _must_ match line
   for line, indent for indent, and character for character.

## 3.14 Challenge 14 (50 points)

**Task**: Implement the function `transform_species()`.

### 3.14.1 Implement `transform_species()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a dictionary representation of a species based on the
passed in `swapi_data` dictionary. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it
is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Assign an empty dictionary to a local variable (name your choice). This "species"
   dictionary will be employed to accumulate new key-value pairs sourced from `data`.

2. Adopt the same key-value pair mapping pattern employed in the `transform_planet()` function. Loop
   over the `keys` dictionary's keys or items (your choice). Inside the loop block employ
   `if-elif-else` conditional statements to populate the new species dictionary with key-value pairs
   sourced from `data`, converting `data` values to more appropriate types as outlined in the
   docstring's mappings section.

### 3.14.2 Call `transform_species()`

After implementing `transform_species()` return to `main()`.

1. Call the function `get_swapi_resource()` and retrieve a SWAPI representation of the human species.
   Make use of the appropriate constant to simplify construction of the URL. Access the "human"
   species dictionary which is stored in the response object and assign the value to
   `swapi_human_species`.

2. Call the function `transform_species()` and pass it the arguments it requires to create a "thinned"
   representation of the human species. Assign the return value to a variable named `human_species`.

3. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `human_species` to the file
   `stu-human_species.json`. Run your code. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-human_species.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and character
   for character.

## 3.15 Challenge 15 (110 points)

**Task**: Implement the function `transform_person()`.

### 3.15.1 Implement `transform_person()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a new person dictionary based on the passed in
`swapi_data` dictionary. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to
perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Assign an empty dictionary to a local variable (name your choice). This "person"
   dictionary will be employed to accumulate new key-value pairs sourced from `data`.

2. Adopt the same key-value mapping pattern employed in the `transform_planet()` function. Loop over
   the `keys` dictionary's keys or items (your choice). Inside the loop block employ `if-elif-else`
   conditional statements to populate the new person dictionary with key-value pairs sourced from
   `data`, converting `data` values to more appropriate types as outlined in the docstring's
   mappings section.

3. Both the "homeworld" and "species" values require special handling (performed inside the loop).

   1. Delegate to the function `get_swapi_resource()` the task of retrieving a dictionary
      representation of the person's home planet.

   2. If the caller passes in a Wookieepedia-sourced `planets` list, delegate to the function
      `utl.get_nested_dict()` the task of retrieving the Wookieepedia representation of the
      "homeworld" from `planets`.

   3. If the person's home planet is also found in `planets` mutate the SWAPI dictionary by enriching
      it with the Wookieepedia data. Employ an in-place operation to accomplish the task.

   4. Transforming the resulting homeworld dictionary is delegated to the function
      `transform_planet()`.

   5. Likewise, delegate to the function `get_swapi_resource()` the task of retrieving a
      representation of the person's species. Transforming the species dictionary is delegated to
      the function `transform_species()`.

### 3.15.2 Call transform_person()

After implementing the function return to `main()`.

1. Call the function `get_swapi_resource()` and retrieve a SWAPI representation of
   the Jedi knight [Anakin Skywalker](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker). Make use
   of the appropriate constant to simplify construction of the URL. Access the "Anakin"
   dictionary which is stored in the response object and assign the value to `swapi_anakin`.

2. Call the function `utl.read_json()` and retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia
   person data in the file `data-wookieepedia_people.json`. Assign the return value to a variable
   named `wookiee_people`.

3. Call the function `utl.get_nested_dict()` and pass it the arguments required to
   retrieve the "Anakin Skywalker" dictionary in `wookiee_people`. Assign the return
   value to a variable named `wookiee_anakin`.

4. Combine the SWAPI and Wookieepedia person dictionaries. Mutate `swapi_anakin` by combining it
   with the Wookieepedia representation of the Jedi knight. Employ an in-place operation to
   accomplish the task.

5. Call the function `transform_person()` and pass it the arguments it requires to create a "thinned"
   representation of the Jedi knight. Assign the return value to a variable named `anakin`.

6. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `anakin` to the file
   `stu-anakin_skywalker.json`. Run your code. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-anakin_skywalker.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and
   character for character.

7. Next, create an "enriched" dictionary representation of the
   [Jedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi) master and general
   [Obi-Wan Kenobi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi). Utilize the same "creational"
   workflow and variable name format employed earlier to create the combined and cleaned dictionary
   representation of Anakin Skywalker.

8. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write Obi-Wan Kenobi (e.g., `obi_wan`) to the file
   `stu-obi_wan_kenobi.json`. Run your code. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-obi_wan_kenobi.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and
   character for character.

## 3.16 Challenge 16 (80 points)

**Task**: Implement the function `transform_starship()`.

### 3.16.1 Implement `transform_starship()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that returns a new starship dictionary based on the passed in
`data` dictionary. Review the function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform,
the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. Assign an empty dictionary to a local variable (name your choice). This "starship" dictionary
   will be employed to accumulate new key-value pairs sourced from `data`.

2. Adopt the same key-value mapping pattern employed in the `transform_planet()` function. Loop over
   the `keys` dictionary's keys or items (your choice). Inside the loop block employ `if-elif-else`
   conditional statements to populate the new starship dictionary with key-value pairs sourced from
   `data`, converting `data` values to more appropriate types as outlined in the docstring's
   mappings section.

### 3.16.2 Call `transform_starship()`

:exclamation: The starship _Twilight_ is sourced from Wookieepedia only. No SWAPI representation of
the light freighter exists.

After implementing `transform_starship()` return to `main()`.

1. Call the `utl.read_csv_to_dicts()` function and retrieve the supplementary Wookieepedia starship
   data in the file `data-wookieepedia_starships.csv`. Assign the return value to `wookiee_starships`.

2. Call `utl.get_nested_dict()` and pass it the arguments required to retrieve the light
   freighter named [_Twilight_](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Twilight) in `wookiee_starships`.
   Assign the return value to a variable named `wookiee_twilight`.

3. Call the function `transform_starship()` and pass it the arguments it requires to create a "thinned"
   representation of the starship. Assign the return value to a variable named `twilight`.

4. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `twilight` to the file `stu-twilight.json`. Run
   your code. Compare your file to the test fixture file `fxt-twilight.json`. Both files _must_
   match line for line, indent for indent, and character for character.

## 3.17 Challenge 17 (75 points)

> R2 are you quite certain that the ship is in this direction? This way looks potentially dangerous. _C-3PO_

**Task**: Implement the function `board_passengers()`. Get Senator Padmé Amidala, the protocol
droid C-3PO, and the astromech droid R2-D2 aboard the _Twilight_ as passengers.

### 3.17.1 Implement `board_passengers()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that assigns a limited number of passengers to a list. Review the
function's docstring to better understand the task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and
the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. The passengers _must_ be passed in a `list` to the `board_passengers()` function.

2. The number of passengers permitted to board a starship or other vehicle is limited by the
    passed in `max_passengers` value. If the number of passengers attempting to board exceeds
    `max_passengers` only the first `n` passengers (where `n` = `max_passengers`) are permitted
    to board the vessel.

   For example, if a starship's `max_passengers` value equals `10` and `20` passengers attempt to
   board the starship, only the first `10` passengers are permitted aboard the vessel.

### 3.17.2 Call `board_passengers()`

After implementing `board_passengers()` return to `main()`.

1. Create a dictionary representation of the Galactic senator
   [Padmé Amidala](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala). Pass the senator's name
   as a `params` value. Utilize the same "creational" workflow employed to create the dictionary
   representations of `anakin` and `obi_wan`. Use the following variable names to represent
   Padmé Amidala.

   * `swapi_padme` (assigned to the SWAPI dictionary)
   * `wookiee_padme` (assigned to the Wookieepedia dictionary)
   * `padme` (assigned to the `transform_person()` return value)

2. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `padme` to the file `stu-padme_amidala.json`.
   Compare your file to the test fixture file `fxt-padme_amidala.json`. Both files _must_ match
   line for line, indent for indent, and character for character.

3. Create a dictionary representation of the protocol droid named
   [C-3PO](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/C-3PO). Pass the droid's name as a `params` value.
   Utilize the same "creational" workflow employed to create `r2_d2`. Consider using the following
   variable names to represent C-3PO.

   * `swapi_c_3po` (assigned to the SWAPI dictionary)
   * `wookiee_c_3po` (assigned to the Wookieepedia dictionary)
   * `c_3po` (assigned to the `transform_droid()` return value)

4. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `c_3po` to the file `stu-c_3po.json`. Compare your
   file to the test fixture file `fxt-c_3po.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line, indent for
   indent, and character for character.

5. Create a `pathlib.Path` object that provides an **absolute** path to the file
   "data-jedi.json". Assign the object to a variable named `filepath`.

   :bulb: The file "data-jedi.json" provides a JSON array of select members of the
   [Jedi Order](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Order). The array includes
   [Mace Windu](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mace_Windu),
   [Plo Koon](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Plo_Koon),
   [Shaak Ti](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shaak_Ti),
   and [Yoda](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yoda).

6. Call the function `utl.read_json()` passing it the argument `filepath`. Assign the return
   value to a variable named `jedi`.

7. Unpack the `jedi` list into the following variables in the order specified:

   1. `mace_windu`
   2. `plo_koon`
   3. `shaak_ti`
   4. `yoda`

8. Assign a variable named `passenger_manifest` to a list literal that contains the following
   elements ordered as follows: `padme`, `c_3po`, `r2_d2`, and the four Jedi (in the order
   unpacked).

9. Uncomment the two `assert` statements and test your implementation of `board_passengers()`.
   Run your code. If an `AssertionError` is raised, debug your code, and then retest. Repeat as
   necessary.

   :bulb: If the function `board_passengers()` is implemented correctly the passed in
   `max_passengers` value will impose a limit on the number of passengers that are permitted to
   board the starship.

10. Next, call the function `board_passengers()` and pass the `twilight` starship's "max_passengers"
   value and a list of passengers comprising `padme`, `c_3po`, and `r2_d2` (in that order) as
   arguments. Assign the return value to the `twilight` dictionary's "passengers_on_board" key.

## 3.18 Challenge 18 (125 points)

> Let's get back to the ship. Power up the engines R2. _Anakin Skywalker_

**Task**: Implement the function `assign_crew_members()`. Assign Anakin Skywalker and
Obi-Wan Kenobi to the _Twilight_ as crew members.

### 3.18.1 Implement `assign_crew_members()`

Replace `pass` with a code block that assigns personnel by position (e.g., pilot, copilot) to a
starship using a dictionary comprehension. Review the function's docstring to better understand the
task it is to perform, the parameters it defines, and the return value it computes.

### Requirements

1. To earn full credit you _must_ create the "crew_members" dictionary by writing a
   **dictionary comprehension** on a **single line**.

   :exclamation: If necessary write a `for` loop that adds the
   position/crew member key-value pairs to an accumulation dictionary named `crew_members`. Get it
   working first and then convert it to a dictionary comprehension.

   :bulb: Avoid looping over the passed in lists. Instead **loop over a sequence of numbers** and
   think carefully about the appropriate stop value to employ in order to limit the number of loop
   iterations. Utilize the sequence of numbers to pair `crew_position` and `personnel` elements by
   their matching index position.

2. The crew positions (e.g., 'pilot', 'copilot') and personnel (e.g., Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan
   Kenobie) must be passed in separate `crew_positions` and `personnel` tuples to the function
   `assign_crew_members()`.

3. Assume that each ship requires a full compliment of personnel to crew the vessel. In other words,
   if a starship's "crew_size" equals three (`3`) you _must_ pass to `assign_crew_members()`
   three crew positions and three personnel.

   Assume too that the maximum number of crew members that can be assigned to a starship is limited
   by the starship's "crew_size" value. No additional crew members are permitted to be assigned to
   the starship even if included in the `crew_positions` and `personnel` tuples. This limitation
   _must_ be imposed from __within__ the dictionary comprehension.

   For example, if a starship's "crew_size" value equals `3` but `4` crew positions/personnel are
   passed to the function only the first `3` crew positions/personnel are permitted to be added
   as key-value pairs to the crew members dictionary.

4. The passed in `crew_positions` and `personnel` tuples _must_ contain the same number of items.
   The individual `crew_positions` and `personnel` items are then paired by index position and
   stored in a dictionary structured as follows:

   ```python
   {< crew_position[0] >: < personnel[0] >, < crew_position[1] >: < personnel[1] >, ...}
   ```

### 3.18.2 Call `assign_crew_members()`

After implementing `assign_crew_members()` return to `main()`.

1. Uncomment the two `assert` statements and test your implementation of `assign_crew_members()`.
   Run your code. If an `AssertionError` is raised, debug your code, and then retest. Repeat as
   necessary.

   :bulb: If the function `assign_crew_members()` is implemented correctly the passed in
   `crew_size` value will impose a limit on the number of crew members that are permitted to
   crew the starship.

2. Call the function `assign_crew_members()` and pass the Twilight's "crew_size" value, a crew
   positions tuple comprising the following string elements: "pilot" and "copilot", and a personnel
   tuple comprising `anakin` and `obi_wan`. Assign the return value to the `twilight` dictionary's
   "crew_members" key.

### 3.18.3 Issue instructions to R2-D2

Create a list containing Anakin's "Power up the engines" order (a string) and map (i.e., assign) the
list to the droid `r2_d2's` "instructions" key.

## 3.19 Challenge 19 (150 points)

**Task**: Sort `wookiee_planets` and then issue commands to R2-D2 to chart a course to the planet
Naboo. Also demonstrate that you can sort a list of dictionaries using a `lambda` function.

### 3.19.1 Sort `wookiee_planets`

1. Write a **single-line list comprehension** that transforms each Wookieepedia-sourced planet
   dictionary in the `wookiee_planets` list by passing each planet referenced in the comprehension
   along with other arguments to the function `transform_planet()`. Assign the new list to a
   variable named `planets`.

   :exclamation: If your list comprehension triggers a `KeyError` exception, check your
   implementation `transform_planet()`. The function is likely attempting to access a key in the
   planet dictionary that does not exist. Recall that there is a friendly `dict` method for dealing
   with such issues; refactor (i.e., revise) your function block accordingly.

2. Perform an **in_place** sort of the `planets` list passing to it as the `key` a `lambda`
   function that sorts the planets **by name**. **Reverse** the sort so that the planets are sorted
   by name in **descending order**.

3. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `planets` to the file
   `stu-planets_sorted_name.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-planets_sorted_name.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and
   character for character.

### 3.19.2 Issue instructions to R2-D2

1. Call the function `utl.get_nested_dict()` and pass it the following arguments: `planets`,
   `diameter_km`, and the integer `12120`. Assign the return value to a variable named `naboo`.

2. Access the `naboo` dictionary's "region" and "sector" values and include the names in a formatted
   string literal (f-string) structured as follows:

   ```python
   "Plot course for Naboo, < region >, < sector >"
   ```

3. Add the f-string to `r2_d2's` "instructions" list so that _Twilight_ can be directed to the
   planet [Naboo](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Naboo), Padmé Amidala's home world.

### 3.19.3 Sort planets by diameter and name

:bulb: If you get stuck on sorting `planets` by "diameter_km" and "name", pause your sorting work
and proceed to the final task ("Escape from the Malevolvence") and complete it. Then return and
restart this standalone task.

1. Employ the built-in function `sorted()` and a `lambda` function to sort `planets` by the
   following attributes:

   | Key | Value | Order |
   | :-- | :---- | :---- |
   | diameter_km | `int` \| `None` | descending |
   | name | ascending | `str` |

2. You _must_ write your `lambda` expression using the **ternary operator** when sorting on
   "diameter_km" because several planets lack a known diameter and in consequence `None` has been
   mapped (i.e., assigned) to their "diameter_km" key.

3. Assign the return value of `sorted()` to a variable named `planets_diameter_km`.

   :exclamation: Write the entire statement on a single line to facilitate auto grader testing:

   ```python
   planets_diameter_km = < expression >
   ```

4. Call the function `utl.write_json()` and write `planets_diameter_km` to the file
   `stu-planets_sorted_diameter.json`. Compare your file to the test fixture file
   `fxt-planets_sorted_diameter.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and
   character for character.

## 3.20 Challenge 20 (140 points)

> R2 release the docking clamp. _Anakin Skywalker_

**Task**: With our heroes on board the _Twilight_ and the engines fired, Anakin Skywalker orders
R2-D2 to release the docking clamp and detach the light freighter _Twilight_ from the stricken
heavy cruiser _Malevolence_. The _Twilight_ then departs to rejoin the Republican fleet before
heading to Naboo. Simulate the escape by updating `r2_d2's` "instructions" and writing the
`twilight` dictionary to a file.

### 3.20.1 Release the docking clamp

Add Anakin's order "Release the docking clamp" to `r2_d2's` "instructions" key-value pair.

### 3.20.2 Escape from the Malevolence

Simulate the _Twilight's_ escape from the _Malevolence_ by writing the `twilight` dictionary to the
file `stu-twilight_departs.json`. Run your code. Compare your file to the test fixture file
`fxt-twilight_departs.json`. Both files _must_ match line for line, indent for indent, and
character for character.

If the files match your job submit your files to Gradescope. If you earn full points your job is
done. Never mind that Separatist starfighters are in hot pursuit of the _Twilight_&mdash;declare
victory!

Congratulations on completing SI 506.
